We should make a spreadsheet that lists the instructions, split into each TYPE and their different FIELDS.
We can basically just follow chapter 4.4 step by step in order to implement it easily, I think.

Have just a "Memory" class, that has public methods "sw" and "lw". Private method call that reads input file in constructor call.
Might need "stackPointer" and "heapPointer" fields, but they should be saved by the assembly program and not the CPU?

Don't decode instructions as we read them, only decode them as we try to execute them, cuz that's how an actual processor does it. that'll allow us to for example change instructions mid program execution, which might be a test case.
