Classes:
    Control.java
    ProgramCounter.java
    RegisterFile.java
    abstract class Memory
        InstructionMemory.java
        DataMemory.java
    ALU.java
    ImmediateGenerator.java


We should make a spreadsheet that lists the instructions, split into each TYPE and their different FIELDS.
We can basically just follow chapter 4.4 step by step in order to implement it easily, I think.
